The construction phase of the LSST project officially concluded with the Operations Readiness Review (ORR) in October 2022.
The contribution to image quality from the as-built LSST system has been measured to be 0.?? arcsec FWHM.
The integrated \'etendue over the 10-year survey is expected to 1.? times
its norminal value as defined by the Science Requirement Document (SRD).
Throughout the construction period, the LSST project had been continuously monitoring the system performance
by evalulating a set of key system metrics against their requirements, and providing updates to the community.
In this paper, we summarize the results of performance evaluations of the final delivered system both on the component level
and on the system level,
and compare the modeled system performance to the measured performance of the as-built system.
